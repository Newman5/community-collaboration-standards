Youtube - Process

The process of preparation and documentation of Youtube was a key component of the weekly community operations.  Each meeting was documented to youtube and required a process to ensure consistency and quality of the information.  This included writing the title, description and other form elements in the youtube upload form.  As well as, steps to download the video properly from Zoom and notify the community of the new content
