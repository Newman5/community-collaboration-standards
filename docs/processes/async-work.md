Async Work - processes

Because of different timezones, levels of engagement and work schedules, asynchronous work is a major factor in project catalyst communities.  C4C used various tools to support working in an async way.  

Loom.io, a short video and screencast tool, was used to further create personal presence for contributions that is not possible to create with text chat / messages alone
