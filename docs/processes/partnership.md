# Partnership and collaborations - Process

Collaboration is at the heart of everything that C4C does.  Itâ€™s a concept that we take from Project Catalyst and Cardano.  Openness, Transparency and decentralisation are themes that fit here.  

Cardano Summit and ImpactFest (details above) as evidence of collaboration.

In the example of the Cardano summit - checkout the linktree: Cardano Summit - [https://linktr.ee/impact.cardanosummit2022](https://linktr.ee/impact.cardanosummit2022)
    
The collaboration started with C4C organising an impact session at the main summit event in Lausanne as well as impact sessions in multiple satellite summit events
    
The session brought together impact projects (i.e. OneUpOneDown, Landano), impact communities (i.e. WADA, Gimbalabs), Impact media (sustainableADA), Impact SPO (ClimateNeturalCardano)
    
Through the work emerge also work of professionals to support the efforts for example Peter with the video production and auditing and Grace mentoring the preparation of presentations.
