# Way of Council

Way of Council - process / framework 

To help grow as a community and allow our full selves to show up and contribute our unique talents, we need to create a safe place where community members can share at the deepest levels, and create an evolutionary method of sensing, advice seeking, and community building.

Format - monthly event with cross catalyst community participation
