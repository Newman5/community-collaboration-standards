## Monthly Events - Process
Monthly events served to focus the community on specific topics and themes. Some of the topics include Plastics and Regenerative Ag

We conducted 9 events beginning in November 2021  and finishing in April 2023

Evolution of the idea.  
    
We started with environmental themes.  
    
And, we moved to a theme in direct support of Project Catalyst community.  Namely, onboarding of new projects and people (“On chain your impact” event), supporting proposal creation, refinement, and focus on an environmental topic (“Carbon and Cardano” event)  and finally, project showcase (ImpactFest event).
    
The last two monthly events we decentralized and opened the planning and operations of the monthly events and shifted the focus to updates from impact based projects.

C4C Playground in the style of Gimbalabs

Adopted from Gimbalabs Playground, The C4C playground was a successful implementation of a meeting planning process based loosely on the ‘Open Spaces’ concept.
