## Welcome
Building a community is hard, but you don't have to do it by yourself. Plenty of other communities have grown up.  There are plenty of standards and best practices that are emerging.

This project is our attempt at collecting these community standards and sharing them with you. It is the summary of our community building experience over the past 18 months.
